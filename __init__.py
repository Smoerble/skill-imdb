    # The "handle_xxxx_intent" function is triggered by Mycroft when the
    # skill's intent is matched.  The intent is defined by the IntentBuilder()
    # pieces, and is triggered when the user's utterance matches the pattern
    # defined by the keywords.  In this case, the match occurs when one word
    # is found from each of the files:
    #    vocab/en-us/Hello.voc
    #    vocab/en-us/Imdb.voc
    # In this example that means it would match on utterances like:
    #   'imdb'
    #   'movie database'

    # In this case, respond by simply speaking a canned response.

    # need to implement stop, you should return True to indicate you handled
